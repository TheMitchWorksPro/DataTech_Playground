    "These scripts make use of reusable objects.  The object code is contained within them but can be deployed on your systems so that updates and enhancements then flow into the final scripts you build.  If you analyze the code, you will notice that abstract objects then have child objects to do the actual work.  In these objects is a seemingly useless function with no definition.  It is there as a placeholder.  \n",

These placeholder functions can then be modified in the child objects to allow you to perform operations on the inputs ahead of creating the outputs.  The intent is to set up inherently extensible code where the coder can focus on what needs to be done to the files and let the underlying objects handle spitting / fusing as designed."
