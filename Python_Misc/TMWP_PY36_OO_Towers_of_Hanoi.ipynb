    "- [The Solution](#solution):  Immediately below is a solution to the problem organized as OO Python code.  This code leverages concepts and ideas from the best of what is found in the research section, but creates a unique implementation that could be used to achieve multiple objectives: output the answer, store the answer, tell us different things about the answer.  This code  also illustrates many concepts of the Python programming language that students and non-experts may find useful.<br/><br/>\n",

    "- .pop() worked on range objects in Python 2.7, they had to be wrapped in list() to work under Python 3.6\n",

    "Theoretically, as simulations grow larger, it may be desirable to have versions of the code that store the results versus versions that do not (so as not to expend the memory storing the steps when the resulting DF is not needed).  Python does support multi-inheritance, and so in theory, the objects could have followed an inheritance scheme like this:\n",

Multi-inheritance increases the complexity of maintenance and creates code that is harder to read and instantly see what it does.
