# DataTech Playground

This project is a test bed for experimentation and creation of data analytics and data science related content.  It is evolving and will contain statistics and data analysis help content files, Python code, and R code.

This is an unfinished preliminary version.  Here are the points of interest in it so far:

## Python

- Python Debugging Investigations:
  - [Debuging Unicode Encoding Issue Under Python 2.7](./PY_Debug_Investigations/PY27_UEE_UDE)
  - [numpy where() - when it appears to fail](./PY_Debug_Investigations)  
- [Misc Python Code](./Python_Misc): 
  - testing for magic squares (w/ numpy),
  - OO Towers of Hanoi Solution Code and related research
  - FileData object, 
  - Normal Distr. Plot with Probability Calc function, 
  - etc.
- [Python Basics](./PY_Basics) - Helpful Topics on Basics and Functioning of the Python Programming Language
  - includes topics on OO, indexing into data structures, list comprehensions, map/reduce/lambda, etc.
  - [Folder of String, Array, and Print related topics](./PY_Basics/str_arr_lst_prnt)
- [Python Basics - Walkthroughs and Inegrated Concepts](./PY_Basics/Walkthroughs) - Documents illustrating several connected things at once

## R Code
- [Calculating Inner and Outer Products w/ R]( http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/TheMitchWorksPro/DataTech_Playground/blob/master/stats/TMWP_MatrixMath_Experimentation.html)
