# DataTech Playground

This project is a test bed for experimentation and creation of data analytics and data science related content.  It is evolving and will contain content files, Python code, and R code.

This is an unfinished preliminary version.  Here are the points of interest in it so far:
- [Exercise in Debuging Unicode Encoding Issue Under Python 2.7](PY27_Error_Investigations/UEE_UDE/)
- [Misc Python Code](DataTech_Playground/Python_Misc/) - testing for magic squares, a FileData object, Normal Distr. Plot with Probability Calc function, etc.
- [Calculating Inner and Outer Products w/ R](stats/TMWP_MatrixMath_Experimentation.html)
