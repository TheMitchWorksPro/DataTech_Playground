# DataTech Playground

This project is a test bed for experimentation and creation of data analytics and data science related content.  It is evolving and will contain statistics and data analysis help content files, Python code, and R code.

This is an unfinished preliminary version.  Here are the points of interest in it so far:
- [Exercise in Debuging Unicode Encoding Issue Under Python 2.7](./PY27_Error_Investigations/UEE_UDE)
- [Misc Python Code](./Python_Misc): 
  - testing for magic squares (w/ numpy),
  - OO Towers of Hanoi Solution Code and related research
  - FileData object, 
  - Normal Distr. Plot with Probability Calc function, 
  - etc.
- [Calculating Inner and Outer Products w/ R]( http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/TheMitchWorksPro/DataTech_Playground/blob/master/stats/TMWP_MatrixMath_Experimentation.html)
- [Python Basics](./PY_Basics) - Helpful Topics on Basics and Functioning of the Python Programming Language
  - [Experiment / Walkthrough w/ Multiple Pythonic Concepts](https://github.com/TheMitchWorksPro/DataTech_Playground/blob/master/PY_Basics/TMWP_Num_Seq_As_Num_Experiment.ipynb) - includes list comprehensions, map(), reduce(), testing type(), etc.
